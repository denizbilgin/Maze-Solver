# Maze Solver

This repository contains implementations of several **maze-solving algorithms**, adhering to the principles of **clean code** and **class-based architecture**. Each algorithm is designed to solve various maze problems efficiently, making the code easy to read, maintain, and extend. The codebase demonstrates the use of well-defined classes, modular functions, and encapsulation, ensuring that the algorithms are both reusable and adaptable.

The implemented algorithms include classic and modern maze-solving techniques:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **A* (A-Star) Algorithm**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **Recursive Backtracking**
- **Wall Follower Algorithm**
- **Dead-End Filling**

Each algorithm is carefully tested and verified for correctness. In the `solutions` folder, you can find PNG files that visually represent the solutions of four different mazes using each implemented algorithm. These images provide a clear illustration of how each algorithm navigates through the mazes.
